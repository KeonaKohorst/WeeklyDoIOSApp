# WeeklyDoIOSApp

This project is a minimalist weekly to-do list app, designed with simplicity in mind. I created it to address my own frustrations with overly complex task managers. Most apps require dates or times to organize tasks, which I find unnecessary for my weekly planning styleâ€”I usually just use the Notes app on my iPhone.

To streamline the experience, this app allows users to create and manage tasks without needing to specify dates or times. However, for tasks that do require scheduling, I added an optional calendar view where you can log time-sensitive items separately.

The app supports both weekly and yearly task tracking. Task deletion is intentionally left to the user, giving you full control over how and when to clear completed items.

App loads, you can see different task filtering options and the progress bar for the current day:

A pin icon indicates which day is the current day.

View all tasks, with a special "General" area for weekly tasks that are not associated with a particular day of the week:

Confetti sprinkles down after a task has been completed, and a message "Nothing to do!" shows when all tasks for a day are done:
